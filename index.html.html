       <hr/> <h2> THE STORY OF HOW I BECAME A PROGRAMMER!</h2>
            <br/><h5>An inspirational story.</h5> 
           <br>My Journey to becoming a programmer is a very uneasy one, I had alot of challenges, I couldn't focus on any language. I went from Python to Html to C#, I  didn't know which one to start with. So I dropped off I decided to go into graphic design because I felt the best  thing is just to quit. I had forgotten the wise saying, Tough times never lasts, but tough people DO! I focused on Graphics Design and I was doing very well, I was earning a few bucks, the feeling was epic you know, <p>  I was earning recognition amidst Graphic Designers when I should be amidst Programmers. But before I got too lost, One of my Seniors in High School back then found me and helped me out. I took my first HTML course after a few words he said to me. And i was happy i took action immediately this is my first web project ever! I have made simple forms using HTML and I decided to take a step further by creating this blog.</p>
             <p> I am preaching my message to all aspirring programmers out there, stop wishing you were an expert in this or that, if wishes were horses, Dear Programmers, even Beggars will ride! I hope you were inspired?</p>
